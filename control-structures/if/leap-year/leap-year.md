Task by Kofler:Java.-2022, 5.8 W1 p. 106

## Rules

### Base rules

- Years divisible by 400 without a remainder are indeed leap years.
- Years divisible by 100 without a remainder are not leap years.
- Years divisible by 4 without a remainder are usually leap years.
- Use 1 if statement only.

### Extended Rules


### My rules

We check only years with 4 digits.
The user must enter a year and a month number.
The month number must be between 1 and 12.

### Examples

From ChatGPT 4o w. Canvas Beta

Here are years that match the conditions:

- 1600: Condition 1 - Divisible by 400 (True)
- 1604: Condition 3 - Divisible by 4, but not by 100 (True)
- 1608: Condition 3 - Divisible by 4, but not by 100 (True)
  
- 1700: Condition 2 - Divisible by 100, but not by 400 (False)

The year 1600 meets the condition of being divisible by 400 and is therefore a leap year. The years 1604 and 1608 are divisible by 4, but not by 100, and are also leap years. A year that is only divisible by 100 (but not by 400) would be, for example, 1700, which is not a leap year.
